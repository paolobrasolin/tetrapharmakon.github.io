Dear all,


WHAT?

we would like to organize a running seminar in category theory at CMUC, starting in September 2019.

You are warmly invited to

- attend the seminars related to topics of your interest
- attend the seminars related to topics that are completely new to you
- join us, giving a seminar of your choice (either from inside or outside the list of topics that already exists)
- really, guys, join us: we can't do all this alone! We have set up a doodle poll where you can express your availability: https://doodle.com/poll/deiv4mcddfuzfh4s Just put you email in the "name" field and tick the boxes according to your preference!

WHATÂ²?

We're joining together to teach and learn in a friendly environment. You are not supposed to master category theory, but it's fundamental that you already like it :-) (if not, join us and we will convince you)

WHEN? WHERE?

There is a website containing all relevant information: http://tetrapharmakon.github.io/coimbra-cosmos/index.html
