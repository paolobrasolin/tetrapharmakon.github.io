title: $t$-structures are normal torsion theories
---

[[PDF]](stuff/tstruct.pdf) My first joint work with [D. Fiorenza][l-Fiorenza], laying the foundations of the theory of $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories under the unifying notion of a "normal torsion theory": as you can see in the abstract, we characterize $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories as suitable quasicategorical factorization systems. More precisely we show that a $t$-structure on a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to a normal torsion theory $\mathbb{F}$ on $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. to a factorization system $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})$ where both classes satisfy the 3-for-2 cancellation property, and a certain compatibility with pullbacks/pushouts.
