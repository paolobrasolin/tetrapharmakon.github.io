[arXiv:1804.08710](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08710) 
We outline a definition of accessible and presentable objects in a 2-category endowed with a Yoneda structure, this perspective suggests a unified treatment of many "Gabriel-Ulmer like" theorems (like the classical Gabriel-Ulmer representation for locally presentable categories, Giraud theorem, Gabriel-Popescu theorem, etc.), asserting how presentable objects arise as reflections of "generating" ones. In a Yoneda structure, whose underlying "presheaf construction" is $\bf P$, two non-equivalent definitions of presentability for $A\in\mathcal{K}$ can be given: in the weakest, it is generally false that all presheaf objects are presentable, this leads to the definition of a Gabriel-Ulmer structure, i.e. a Yoneda structure rich enough to concoct Gabriel-Ulmer duality and to make this asimmetry disappear. We end the paper with a roundup of examples, involving classical (set-based and enriched) and low- as well as higher-dimensional category theory.
