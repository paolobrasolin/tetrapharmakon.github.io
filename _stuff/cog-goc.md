[[PDF]](stuff/manifesto.pdf) This is the first experiment of a meeting I organized with some friends and colleagues (M. Porta, A. Gagna, G. Mossa and many others) in order to get updated (and "enriched" --pun intended) about their research and interests. M. Porta patiently introduced me to the arcane misteries of bits of "higher" language, exposing me to little pieces of his [thesis][l-thesis] and of the collective [seminar][l-seminar] <i>Autour de DAG</i>.<br> &nbsp; As for its philosophical side, <b>GoC-CoG</b> can be defined as an <i>experimental window open to autonomous research</i>, where the word "research" has to be understood in etymological sense: the daily struggle of a bunch of curious minds towards Gnosis, the firm determination to avoid the fragmented, edonistic tendency of a certain modern mathematical practice, which concentrates collective efforts on solving a particular instance of a problem instead of <i>building a theory</i> eroding our questions millennium after millennium.<br> &nbsp; (<i>Someday you will also see the videos of our "conferences"...</i>)
