bio: >
 <em>Ma olen matemaatik</em>.<br> I enjoy category theory, stable homotopy theory, computations with the Serre spectral sequence, functional programming, proof assistants, bicategories of profunctors, the deep meaning of the integral sign, lager beers, artificial and natural languages, sharpening knives, Shunga paintings, drawing maps, calligraphy, typography. Most of all, I love linking all these things.<br><br>

 See my CV <a href="stuff/short-civi.pdf">here</a>. My email is <a href="#contacts">below</a>. My interests grew too far apart to be described by a research statement any more. Let's just say that I do category theory here, category theory there. <a href="mms.pdf">Here</a>, however, I compiled a short presentation about my past work.
