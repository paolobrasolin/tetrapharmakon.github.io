bio: >
    I am a mathematician. I enjoy stuff like category theory, 
    stable homotopy theory, computations with the Serre spectral sequence, 
    TeXniques to write math notes, lager 
    beers, artificial languages, Japanese philosophy, maps, 
    typography and how to link all these things. <br><br>

    See my CV <a href="stuff/short-civi.pdf">here</a>. You can email
    me at <b>fosco.loregian@gmail.com</b> (istitutional emails change fast!). <br><br>

    I do lots of things. You can see a more detailed version of my research interests
