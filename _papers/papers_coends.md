[[PDF]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02503) â€¢ A short note about coend calculus. Co/ends are awesome, once you try to use them, your mathematical life changes forever. I put a considerable
effort in making the arguments and constructions rather explicit: even if at some point I decided to come up with an arXiv-ed version, this document must be thought as a never-ending accumulation of examples, constructions and techniques which are better understood by means of co/ends. Feel free to give advices on how to improve the discussion!
