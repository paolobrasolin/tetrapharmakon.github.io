title: Hearts and Towers in stable $\infty$-categories
---

[This](https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04658) is the second joint work with [D. Fiorenza][l-Fiorenza], about $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories, which shows that in the $\infty$-categorical setting semiorthogonal decompositions on a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ arise decomposing morphisms in the <i>Postnikov tower</i> induced by a chain of $t$-structures, regarded (thanks to our previous [work][l-work]) as multiple factorization systems on $\mathcal{C}$.

&nbsp; A slightly unexpected result is that $t$-structures having stable classes, i.e. such 
that both classes are stable $\infty$-subcategories of $\mathcal{C}$, are precisely the 
<i>fixed points</i> for the natural action of $\mathbb Z$ on the set of $t$-structures, given 
by the shift endofunctor.
