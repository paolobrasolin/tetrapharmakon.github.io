[arXiv:1806.06129](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06129) and [REF](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086918300872) â€¢ Fibrations over a category $B$, introduced to category theory by Grothendieck, encode pseudo-functors $B^\text{op} \rightsquigarrow {\bf Cat}$, while the special case of discrete fibrations encode presheaves $B^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$. A two-sided discrete variation encodes functors $B^\text{op} \times A \to {\bf Set}$, which are also known as profunctors from $A$ to $B$. By work of Street, all of these fibration notions can be defined internally to an arbitrary 2-category or bicategory. While the two-sided discrete fibrations model profunctors internally to ${\bf Cat}$, unexpectedly, the dual two-sided codiscrete cofibrations are necessary to model ${\mathcal V}$-profunctors internally to ${\mathcal V}$-${\bf Cat}$.
