[1804.08710](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08710) and [JPAA](xxx.yyy.zzz) â€¢ We outline a definition of accessible and presentable objects in a 2-category K endowed with a "KZ context", that is to say a pair of lax-idempotent monads interacting in a prescribed way; this perspective suggests a unified treatment of many "Gabriel-Ulmer like" theorems, asserting how presentable objects arise as reflections of generating ones. We outline the notion of "(Gabriel-Ulmer) envelope" for a KZ context, sufficient to concoct Gabriel-Ulmer duality. We end the paper with a roundup of examples, involving classical (set-based and enriched), low dimensional category theory, and a perspective for future work, rooted in higher category theory and homotopy theory.
