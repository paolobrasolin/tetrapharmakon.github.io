[1705.08565](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08565) •
We define triangulated factorization systems on a given triangulated category, and prove that a suitable subclass thereof (the normal triangulated torsion theories) corresponds bijectively to t-structures on the same category.
This result is then placed in the framework of derivators regarding a triangulated category as the underlying category of a stable derivator. More generally, we define derivator factorization systems in the 2-category $\mathbf{PDer}$, also formally describing them as algebras for a suitable strict 2-monad (this result is of independent interest), and prove that a similar characterization still holds true: for a stable derivator $\mathbb{D}$, a suitable class of derivator factorization systems (the normal derivator torsion theories) correspond bijectively with t-structures on the underlying category $\mathbb{D}(e)$ of the derivator. These two result can be regarded as the triangulated- and derivator- analogues, respectively, of the theorem that says that `t-structures are normal torsion theories' in the setting of stable ∞-categories, showing how the result remains true whatever the chosen model for stable homotopy theory is.
