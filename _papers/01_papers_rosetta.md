title: $t$-structures are normal torsion theories
---

[arXiv:1408.7003](https://arxiv.org/abs/1408.7003) and [REF](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10485-015-9393-z) â€¢ My first joint work with [D. Fiorenza][l-fiorenza], laying the foundations of the theory of $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories under the unifying notion of a "normal torsion theory": as you can see in the abstract, we characterize $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories as suitable quasicategorical factorization systems. More precisely we show that a $t$-structure on a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to a normal torsion theory $\mathbb{F}$ on $\mathcal{C}$, i.e. to a factorization system $(\mathcal{E}, \mathcal{M})$ where both classes satisfy the 3-for-2 cancellation property, and a certain compatibility with pullbacks/pushouts.
