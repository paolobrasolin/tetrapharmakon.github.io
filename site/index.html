In both cases, we describe the process of bounding a net internally, by just constructing new categories of executions of a net using comonads, and externally, using lax-monoidal-lax functors. Our external semantics is non-local, meaning that tokens are endowed with properties that say something about the global state of the net. We then prove, in both cases, that the internal and external constructions are equivalent, by using machinery built on top of the Grothendieck construction. The individual-token case is harder, as it requires a more explicit reliance on abstract methods.</p> </dd> <dt id="18_mana"> <a href="#18_mana">Nets with Mana - A Framework for Chemical Reaction Modelling</a> <time> Jan 2021 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06234">2101.06234</a> • We use categorical methods to define a new flavor of Petri nets which could be useful in modelling chemical reactions.</p> </dd> <dt id="17_papers_erkennen"> <a href="#17_papers_erkennen">Functorial Erkennen</a> <time> Dec 2020 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/18519/1/philsci-erkennen.pdf">[PDF]</a> • The second chapter of a series devoted to join category theory and ontology.</p> </dd> <dt id="16_papers_pqcoends"> <a href="#16_papers_pqcoends">Coends of higher arity</a> <time> Nov 2020 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13881">2011.13881</a> • We specialise a recently introduced notion of generalised dinaturality for functors $T : (\mathcal{C}^\text{op})^p \times \mathcal{C}^q \to \mathcal{D}$ to the case where the domain (resp., codomain) is constant, obtaining notions of ends (resp., coends) of higher arity, dubbed herein (p,q)-ends (resp., (p,q)-coends). While higher arity co/ends are particular instances of “totally symmetrised” (ordinary) co/ends, they serve an important technical role in the study of a number of new categorical phenomena, which may be broadly classified as two new variants of category theory.<br />   The first of these, weighted category theory, consists of the study of weighted variants of the classical notions and construction found in ordinary category theory, besides that of a limit. This leads to a host of varied and rich notions, such as weighted Kan extensions, weighted adjunctions, and weighted ends.<br />   The second, diagonal category theory, proceeds in a different (albeit related) direction, in which one replaces universality with respect to natural transformations with universality with respect to dinatural transformations, mimicking the passage from limits to ends. In doing so, one again encounters a number of new interesting notions, among which one similarly finds diagonal Kan extensions, diagonal adjunctions, and diagonal ends.</p> </dd> <dt id="15_papers_partiallaw"> <a href="#15_papers_partiallaw">Functorial semantics for partial theories</a> <time> Nov 2020 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/eat-popl.pdf">[PDF]</a> • We provide a Lawvere-style definition for partial theories, extending the classical notion of equational theory by allowing partially defined operations. As in the classical case, our definition is syntactic: we use an appropriate class of string diagrams as terms. This allows for equational reasoning about the class of models defined by a partial theory. We demonstrate the expressivity of such equational theories by considering a number of examples, including partial combinatory algebras and cartesian closed categories. Moreover, despite the increase in expressivity of the syntax we retain a well-behaved notion of semantics: we show that our categories of models are precisely locally finitely presentable categories, and that free models exist.</p> </dd> <dt id="14_papers_ontology"> <a href="#14_papers_ontology">Categorical Ontology I - Existence</a> <time> May 2020 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/17679/1/luniv-ontology1.pdf">[PDF]</a> • The first chapter of a series devoted to join category theory and ontology.</p> </dd> <dt id="13_papers_proptic"> <a href="#13_papers_proptic">Profunctor optics, a categorical update</a> <time> Jan 2020 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.07488">2001.07488</a> • Profunctor optics are bidirectional data accessors that capture data transformation patterns such as accessing subfields or iterating over containers. They are modular, meaning that we can construct accessors for complex structures by combining simpler ones. Profunctor optics have been studied only using <strong>Sets</strong> as the enriching category and in the non-mixed case. However, functional programming languages are arguably better described by enriched categories and we have found that some structures in the literature are actually mixed optics. Our work generalizes a classic result by Pastro and Street on Tambara theory and uses it to describe mixed V-enriched profunctor optics and to endow them with $\mathcal{V}$-category structure. We provide some original families of optics and derivations, including an elementary one for traversals that solves an open problem posed by Milewski. Finally, we discuss a Haskell implementation.</p> </dd> <dt id="12_papers_stdadj"> <a href="#12_papers_stdadj">A standard theorem on adjunctions in two variables</a> <time> Feb 2019 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06074">1902.06074</a> and <a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preblob/5950">REF</a> • We record an explicit proof of the theorem that lifts a two-variable adjunction to the arrow categories of its domains.</p> </dd> <dt id="11_papers_fubone"> <a href="#11_papers_fubone">A Fubini rule for $\infty$-coends</a> <time> Feb 2019 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.06086">1902.06074</a> and <a href="https://www.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/preblob/5952">REF</a> • We prove a Fubini rule for $\infty$-co/ends of $\infty$-functors $F : \mathcal{C}^\text{op}\times\mathcal{C}\to \mathcal{D}$.</p> </dd> <dt id="10_papers_yosegi"> <a href="#10_papers_yosegi">On the unicity of formal category theories</a> <time> Jan 2019 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01594">1901.01594</a> • We prove an equivalence between cocomplete Yoneda structures and certain proarrow equipments on a 2-category K. In order to do this, we recognize the presheaf construction of a cocomplete Yoneda structure as a relative, lax idempotent monad sending each admissible 1-cell to an adjunction. Each cocomplete Yoneda structure on K arises in this way from a relative lax idempotent monad “with enough adjoint 1-cells”, whose domain generates the ideal of admissibles, and the Kleisli category of such a monad equips its domain with proarrows. We call these structures “yosegi”. Quite often, the presheaf construction associated to a yosegi generates an ambidextrous Yoneda structure; in such a setting there exists a fully formal version of Isbell duality.</p> </dd> <dt id="09_papers_fibrations"> <a href="#09_papers_fibrations">Categorical notions of fibration</a> <time> Jun 2018 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.06129">1806.06129</a> and <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0723086918300872">REF</a> • Fibrations over a category $B$, introduced to category theory by Grothendieck, encode pseudo-functors $B^\text{op} \rightsquigarrow {\bf Cat}$, while the special case of discrete fibrations encode presheaves $B^\text{op} \to {\bf Set}$. A two-sided discrete variation encodes functors $B^\text{op} \times A \to {\bf Set}$, which are also known as profunctors from $A$ to $B$. By work of Street, all of these fibration notions can be defined internally to an arbitrary 2-category or bicategory.

In a Yoneda structure, whose underlying “presheaf construction” is $\bf P$, two non-equivalent definitions of presentability for $A\in\mathcal{K}$ can be given: in the weakest, it is generally false that all presheaf objects are presentable, this leads to the definition of a Gabriel-Ulmer structure, i.e. a Yoneda structure rich enough to concoct Gabriel-Ulmer duality and to make this asimmetry disappear.

This result is then placed in the framework of derivators regarding a triangulated category as the underlying category of a stable derivator. More generally, we define derivator factorization systems in the 2-category $\mathbf{PDer}$, also formally describing them as algebras for a suitable strict 2-monad (this result is of independent interest), and prove that a similar characterization still holds true: for a stable derivator $\mathbb{D}$, a suitable class of derivator factorization systems (the normal derivator torsion theories) correspond bijectively with t-structures on the underlying category $\mathbb{D}(e)$ of the derivator.

Fiorenza</a>, about $t$-structures in stable $\infty$-categories, which studies recollements. We develop the theory of recollements in a stable $\infty$-categorical setting. In the axiomatization of Beilinson, Bernstein and Deligne, recollement situations provide a generalization of Grothendieck’s “six functors” between derived categories. The adjointness relations between functors in a recollement induce a “recollee” $t$-structure on $\mathcal{D}$, given $t$-structures $t_0$, $t_1$ on $\mathcal{D}_0$, $\mathcal{D}_1$. Such a classical result, well known in the setting of triangulated categories, acquires a new taste when $t$-structure are described as suitable ($\infty$-categorical) factorization systems: the corresponding factorization system enjoys a number of interesting formal properties and unexpected autodualities. In the geometric case of a stratified space, various recollements arise, which “interact well” with the combinatorics of the intersections of strata to give a well-defined, associative operation. From this we deduce a generalized associative property for $n$-fold gluings, valid in any stable $\infty$-category.</p> </dd> <dt id="02_papers_hearts"> <a href="#02_papers_hearts">Hearts and Towers in stable $\infty$-categories</a> <time> Jan 2015 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04658">[PDF]</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40062-019-00237-0">REF</a> • We exploit the equivalence between $t$-structures and normal torsion theories on a stable $\infty$-category to show how a few classical topics in the theory of triangulated categories, i.e., the characterization of bounded $t$-structures in terms of their hearts, their associated cohomology functors, semiorthogonal decompositions, and the theory of tiltings, as well as the more recent notion of Bridgeland’s slicings, are all particular instances of a single construction, namely, the tower of a morphism associated with a $J$-slicing of a stable $\infty$-category $\mathcal{C}$, where $J$ is a totally ordered set equipped with a monotone $\mathbb{Z}$-action.</p> </dd> <dt id="03_papers_coends"> <a href="#03_papers_coends">Coend Calculus</a> <time> Dec 2014 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.02503">[PDF]</a> • The book is about to appear in the LNM series of Cambridge University Press.

They appear in a number of forms: as “fully dualizable” strict monoidal categories, internal categories in $\mathbf{Grp}$, internal groups in $\mathbf{Cat}$, crossed modules, strict 2-groupoids with a single object…<br />  This variety of incarnations gives a very rich theory which can be built by the power of analogy with the set-theoretic case: my exposition will concentrate mostly on two sides of the story:</p> <ol> <li><a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0407463">0407463</a> As set-theoretic groups can be linearly represented on vectors spaces, so 2-groups can be 2-linearly represented on 2-vector spaces, thanks to a construction by Voevodsky and Kapranov; the category 2-$\mathbf{Vect}$ carries an astoundingly rich structure, and so does the category of representations Fun($\mathbf{G}$, 2-$\mathbf{Vect}$).</li> <li><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0801.3843">0801.3843</a> As (suitably tame) topological groups give Cech theory of principal G-bundles, so 2-groups give Cech theory of principal 2-bundles; Cech cocycles can be characterized, thanks to an idea by G. Segal, as suitable functors, allowing to recover a categorified Cech theory of “2-bundles”.</li> </ol> </dd> <dt id="misc_stacks"> <a href="#misc_stacks">NOTES - Homotopical interpretation of stack theory</a> <time> Apr 2013 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/stacks2.pdf">[PDF]</a> In their paper “<em><a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2FBFb0084222">Strong stacks and classifying spaces</a></em>” A. Joyal and M. Tierney provide an ​internal characterization of the classical (or ‘‘folk’’) model structure on the category of groupoids in a Grothendieck topos <i>E</i>. The fibrant objects in the classical model structure on $\mathbf{Gpd}(\mathcal{E})$ are called ‘‘strong stacks’’, as they appear as a strengthening of the notion of stack in $\mathcal{E}$ (i.e. an internal groupoid object in $\mathcal{E}$ subject to a certain condition which involves ‘‘descent data’’). The main application is when $\mathcal{E}$ is the topos of simplicial sheaves on a space or on a site: in that case then strong stacks are intimately connected with classifying space​s of simplicial groups.</p> <p>  Adapting the presentation to the audience needed a ‘‘gentle introduction’’ to Topos Theory and the internalization philosophy of Category Theory, and a more neat presentation of the folk model structure on $\mathbf{Gpd}(\mathbf{Set})$ (not to mention the original article by Joyal and Tierney was <em>utterly</em> hard-to-read, so I tried to fill some holes and unraveled some prerequisites).</p> </dd> <dt id="misc_aqft"> <a href="#misc_aqft">NOTES - Categorification on AQFT</a> <time> Mar 2013 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/vonneu2.pdf">[PDF]</a> Classical AQFT can be defined as a cosheaf $\mathcal{A}$ of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras on the manifold of space-time (or more generally, on a suitable lorentzian manifold playing such rôle) <i>M</i>, satisfying two axioms: <b>locality</b>, ensuring that observables in an open region are <i>a fortiori</i> observables in any superset of that region, and <b>causality</b>, ensuring that If $U,V$ are spacelike separated regions, then $\mathcal A(U)$ and $\mathcal A(V)$ pairwise commute as subalgebras of $\mathcal A(M)$.<br /></p> <p>  Now what if we want to suitably <i>categorify</i> this notion, extending it to the realm of tensor categories (that is, categories equipped with a tensor functor subject to suitable axioms)? Causality has to be replaced by a higher-categorical analogue of the concept of commutators of a subalgebra of $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb H)$ and Von Neumann algebras, leading to the definition of a <i>Von Neumann category</i> as a subcategory of $\mathbf{Hilb}_{\mathbb H}$ which equals its double commutant.</p> </dd> <dt id="misc_homotocstar"> <a href="#misc_homotocstar">NOTES - Homotopical Algebra for $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras</a> <time> Dec 2012 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/model2.pdf">[PDF]</a> Homotopical Algebra showed to be extremely fruitful in studying categories of “things that resemble spaces” and structured spaces, keeping track of their structure in the step-by-step construction of abstract homotopy invariants; so in a certain sense it is natural to apply this complicated machinery to the category $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$: all in all, Gel’fand-Naimark’s theorem tells that there exists an equivalence \(\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}\cong \mathbf{LCHaus}.\)</p> <p>  Starting from this we shouldn’t be surprised by the existence of homotopical methods in $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebra theory, and it should be natural to spend a considerable effort to endow $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$ with a model structure, maybe exploiting one of the various pre-existing model structures on $\mathbf{Top}$: this is (almost) what [Uuye] proposed in his article.</p> <p>  The main problem is that the category of $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras admits a homotopical calculus which can’t be extended to a full model structure in the sense of [Quillen]. This is precisely Theorem 5.2, which we take from [Uuye], who repeats an unpublished argument by Andersen and Grodal; the plan to overcome this difficulty is to seek for a weaker form of Homotopical Calculus, still fitting our needs. To this end, the main reference is [Brown]’s thesis, which laid the foundations of this weaker abstract Homotopy Theory, based on the notion of “category with fibrant objects”. Instead of looking for a full model structure on $\mathrm{C}^\ast\text{-}\mathbf{Alg}$ we seek for a fibrant one, exploiting the track drawn by [Uuye]’s paper, which is the main reference of the talk together with [Brown]’s thesis.</p> </dd> <dt id="misc_grad"> <a href="#misc_grad">THESIS - My MSc thesis</a> <time> Jul 2012 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/tmesi.pdf">[PDF]</a> <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Dmitri+Orlov">Orlov</a> spent lots of years studying the derived category $\mathbf{D}^b_\text{coh}(X)$ of coherent sheaves on a variety $X$; in the spirit of <a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/reconstruction+theorem">reconstruction theory</a>, lots of algebraic properties of the category itself reflect into geometric properties of the space $X$.</p> </dd> <dt id="misc_hamilton"> <a href="#misc_hamilton">NOTES - Hamiltonian Mech (IT)</a> <time> Jun 2011 </time> </dt> <dd><p><a href="stuff/gedi.pdf">[PDF]</a> My first love is <b>Mathematical Physics</b>, I cannot hide it.
