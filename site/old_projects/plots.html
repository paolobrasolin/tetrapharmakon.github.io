<p>A small category is a monoid with more than one object.</p>

<p>Now, if we do Abstract Algebra <em>à la Bourbaki</em>, monoids appear as rather
highly-structured objects: they are unital, associative, total magmas
(<em>total</em>, opposed to partial, means the operation is everywhere
defined).</p>

<p>What happens when you try to understand what is a “partial magma with
more than one object”?</p>

<p>In a few words, you get these things called <em>plots</em> studied in
Tringali’s “<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3524">Plots and Their 
Applications - Part I: Foundations</a>” where
your composition is not defined for each pair of consecutive arrows, and
even if it’s defined it is possibly non-associative. Finally, you don’t
have identities everywhere. Salvatore is a good friend of mine, and I’ve
been pleased to slightly collaborate to his visionary project. I
definitely fell in love with it.</p>

<p>Even if it’s difficult to believe so, even in such a poorly behaved
setting one is able to find interesting results, and the theory
established so far is everything but an empty academic exercise.</p>

<p>In (what we would like to call) <em>plot theory</em> you can define
<em>isomorphisms</em> (yes, <em>without</em> having identities), and notice that
“being an isomorphism” and “admitting an inverse” are <em>different</em>
notions in the world of plots: the two notions collapse in category
theory (a category is an associative plot, where the composition is
defined and every object has a unit, in the same vein a monoid is an
“extremely smooth partial magma”). You can then define <em>isoids</em>, i.e.
plots where every arrow is an isomorphism.</p>

<p>Salvatore is even able to define morphisms of plots (<em>p</em>unctors),
natural transformations (<em>trimmings</em>, if I remember well the name I
helped him to chose to continue the sartorial inspiration), adjoints,
limits, and a chain of free-forgetful adjunctions which connects the
category (it <em>is</em> a category!) $\mathbf{Plt}$ of plots to the category of
associative plots, semi-categories [the obvious forgetful has two
adjoints, left and right, giving two different completions], and
categories.</p>

<p>Salvo to-do list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What’s a $n$-dimensional version of these guys?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How can one define classical category theoretic notions (Kan
extensions, adjunctions between punctors and their monads [do we
obtain…<em>magmads</em>?], representables…are they still the same or not?)
in the setting of plots?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What is the localization of a plot with respect to a family of
arrows, given that we lack associativity and unitality?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How about a “simplicial” <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">pov</span>? Is there a
<a href="http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/geometric+shape+for+higher+structures">shape</a>
giving $\mathbf{Plt}$ as a full subcategory of a category of
presheaves, in the same way
$\mathbf{Cat}\subset [\Delta^\text{op}, \mathbf{Sets}]$ and
semi-categories arise as suitable <em>semi</em>simplicial sets
(“degeneracies give identities”)?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about enrichment (whatever this means, in this context)? Can we
do “formal” plot theory?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Functional analysis and symplectic geometry provide “natural factories”
(read Examples <strong>10</strong>-<strong>14</strong> of Salvatore’s paper) of examples for such
structures. As a toy example, one of our two unitization functors
applied to the category of symplectic relations gives precisely the
Woodward-Wehrheim category.</p>
