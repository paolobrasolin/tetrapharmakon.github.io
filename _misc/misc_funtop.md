title: "Functorial topology"

The first reason I chose to study Mathematics is Algebraic Topology. 
Despite the intrinsic complexity of the topic, I can't abandon the idea that this is the 
most elegant (=abstract) way to look at Geometry, so with the passing of time I cared to 
refine my understanding about homotopy theory, homological algebra and suchlike, accepting
 that the main reason Category Theory was invented is to turn Algebraic Topologist's 
<i>deliria</i> into rigorous statements. The "tentative complements" arose with two 
short-term goals, but rapidly fell off to become the draft of a draft: 1) explicitly 
solve some exercises nobody publicly solves (they're often left to the <i>conscious 
reader</i>, but mathematicians are often lazy people) and 2) give a categorical flavour
 even to basic statements on both General and basic Algebraic Topology. The "short intro"
 arose to extend and publicly propose one of the cornerstones in advanced Homological 
Algebra: triangulated categories
